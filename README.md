Compute the FMO1 potential for separated monomers (2-electron terms at the Hartree-Fock level). 
The basic FMO reference is: 
D.G. Fedorov, K. Kitaura, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 6832-6840(2004). 
The proxy evaluates the most expensive part, being the second term (in curly brackets) on the right-hand-side of Eq. (5), of the above paper, for x=1, and including (for convenience) K=x. 
This paper- 
T. Nakano, et al, Chemical Physics Letters 351 (2002) 475â€“480. 
-describes the long- and intermediate-range electrostatic approximations, that is, eqns. (12) and (13).
